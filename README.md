## üß† Quantum Computing Division ‚Äì RSA Factoring Demonstration

**Subject:** Implementation of Shor‚Äôs Algorithm for Integer Factorization  
**Platform:** Qiskit (IBM Quantum)  
**Objective:** Demonstrate quantum-assisted factorization of RSA semiprime `n = 143`

---

This repository presents a verified simulation of **Shor‚Äôs Algorithm**, executed via Qiskit‚Äôs quantum simulator backend (`aer_simulator`).  
The goal is to break RSA encryption by factoring a small semiprime integer using quantum logic gates, including Hadamard and CNOT operations.

> The implementation demonstrates how quantum computers can efficiently solve the integer factorization problem, which forms the basis of classical cryptographic protocols such as RSA.

All code is modular, commented, and designed for reproducibility.  
This simulation lays the groundwork for future advancements in post-quantum cryptanalysis.

Factoring larger semiprimes (e.g., 2048-bit RSA keys) remains beyond current quantum hardware capabilities.
